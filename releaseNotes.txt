1. Introduction

JasperReports Server is a high-performance standalone or
embeddable Business Intelligence (BI) platform that provides
rich reporting and integrated in-memory analysis capabilities.

These release notes describe the installation and available
functionality at a high level; for details, please refer to the
online help. Please also refer to the documentation, which is
available at: http://community.jaspersoft.com/documentation
or at <js-install>/docs after installation. In particular,
refer to the Installation Guide for instructions about running
the installer, creating and updating the database, and deploying 
the WAR file; refer to the Upgrade Guide for instructions on 
upgrading from previous versions.

Note: JasperReports Server is governed by a License Agreement,
the text of which is found at <js-install>/Jaspersoft-
Subscription-Services-Agreement.txt. Please read it before you
login to JasperReports Server for the first time. If you
installed the server using the installer binary (rather than
deploying a WAR file), you have already agreed to this license.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
2. What's New

JasperReports Server 6.0.1 includes these improvements:

 * Custom Visualization Component - This new Jaspersoft Studio 
   Community-supported component lets you leverage third-party
   JavaScript libraries, such as D3, in Jaspersoft Studio and
   JasperReports Server. For details, please see:
   http://tinyurl.com/lvvuaoj
   
   Please note that this component is only supported by the 
   Jaspersoft Community (http://community.jaspersoft.com). 
   Jaspersoft Technical Support and Engineering do not currently 
   provide support for this feature.
 
   The custom visualization component is a powerful and flexible 
   feature, suitable for advanced users of JasperReports. Using 
   the component requires advanced coding skills in the 
   following technologies:
    - JavaScript
    - CSS
    - HTML/DHTML
    - The third-party library you want to expose in Jaspersoft 
	  Studio and jasperReports Server.

 * Updated Spring Security - Starting in this release, the server 
   now incorporates a more recent version of the underlying Spring
   Security framework. we now use Spring Security 3. The new 
   version offers improved application security. 
   
   If you are upgrading from a previous version of JasperReports
   Server, you may need to take additional steps to accommodate
   the file structure of the new version of Spring. This is
   particularly the case if you have custom LDAP or SSO
   configured for the server. For more information, refer
   to the JasperReports Server External Authentication Guide.
 
JasperReports Server 6.0.0 added these improvements:

 * New Dashboards - A new web-based dashboard design environment 
   lets you create web responsive dashboards that include new 
   visualizations, reports, Ad Hoc views, input controls, filters
   and web pages. Dashlets dragged onto the canvas automatically
   resize to fit the available space. This is a significant 
   improvement over the legacy dashboard designer that required 
   multiple tools to create content. The new dashboard designer 
   makes it easy to create dashlets with title bars, include 
   formatted text, set advanced properties to control the look 
   and feel, and re-wire filters to specific dashlets.
   
   Notes:
   - Dashboards created with the prior designer are not 
     compatible with the new dashboard designer; they are marked 
	 as legacy dashboards. You can still view and edit them using 
	 the legacy dashboard designer.
   - The new dashboard environment doesn't currently support some 
     capabilities of legacy dashboards:
     - The ability to pass a parameter to Web Page dashlets.
     - The ability to add file-type resources (such as images) to 
	   dashlets.
     - The ability to pass parameters using HTTP page references.
     - Self-targeted hyperlinks that come from embedded reports

 * Visualize.js - With this release, you can now directly embed 
   our new dashboards into web pages through JavaScript, letting
   web designers leverage the power of our new dashboards, 
   including setting filter values directly from within any 
   web page. This release adds:
    - New support to run, refresh, and cancel dashboards,
      including setting filter values.
    - More support for reports, including report zoom, export to 
      JSON and CSV formats, and the ability to fetch data from 
	  the server.
	   
	 For details, refer to the JasperReports Server Visualize.js 
	 Guide (formerly, the JasperReports Server Programming Guide).
	 
 * Interactive Reports - The web UI's report viewer now includes:
   - Ad Hoc Filter Value Display - Lets report designers
     create an Ad Hoc Report Template in Jaspersoft Studio that 
	 displays Ad Hoc filter values when viewing an Ad Hoc Report.
   - Workbooks and Table of Contents - Lets report designers
     create a JRXML report that contains workbook sections and a 
	 Table of Contents that is displayed as a tabbed report in 
	 the server's report viewer. The table of contents is also 
	 created when the workbook is exported; for example, a PDF 
	 would include table of contents hyperlinked to specific 
	 report pages. This eliminates the need to write code that
	 was required to consolidate multiple reports and generate a
	 table of contents in previous releases.
   - Variable Page Format Support - Lets report designers combine 
     reports that have varying page layout formats within a 
	 single workbook. This lets the designer create highly 
	 customized content within a single report.
   - Floating Cross Tab Headings -  When viewing a long crosstab
     report, headings are displayed and move with your view 
	 as you scroll.

 * Ad Hoc Views - Two new chart types have been added to Ad Hoc 
   views:
   - Heat Map - Lets you visualize color-coded ranges of 
     data across x- and y-axis for a single measure to quickly 
	 highlight outliers.
   - Time Series Heat Map - Lets you visualize color-coded ranges
     of data across a combination of a date/time field, and 
	 non-date field for a single measure to quickly 
     highlight outliers.
   - Lets you control the formatting of legends and various 
     labels to make better use of the chart canvas. This feature 
	 is especially valuable when charts are used in dashboards.
   
   Jaspersoft Studio (R) also supports the new chart types.

 * Domains Complex Joins - We have enhanced our join 
   functionality to include complex operators (listed below). 
   This feature is only available by directly editing the 
   Domain XML file; once the Domain XML is edited, you can't
   use the Domain designer  to edit the Domain. 
   Complex joins: 
   - Can use constants for comparisons in join expressions.
   - Support for more types of operators beyond equality (=), 
     including !=, >,<,<=,>=, IN, and NOT IN.
   - Clear specification of join types (inner join, left outer 
     join, and right outer join).
   - Address a previous issue of OR joins not being recognized 
     properly.
 
 * Data staging - A new configuration of JasperReports Server 
   allows Ad Hoc views and reports to keep and refresh datasets 
   in the Ad Hoc cache indefinitely. This can drastically improve 
   performance for datasets that can be stored in the cache. A new 
   UI setting allows you select data staging independently in every 
   Domain Topic you create.
 
  * Organization and Server Level Attributes - New profile 
   attributes support hierarchical and categorical attributes at 
   the user, organization, and server levels. You can refer 
   these attributes while developing reports in Jaspersoft 
   Studio and while defining data sources in JasperReports 
   Server, OLAP access grants, and Domain security files. The 
   new profile attributes make organization management much more flexible and 
   robust. You can define parameter-based data sources using 
   attributes defined at user, organization, and server levels. 
   The value 
   of attributes are replaced only at run time; thus making it 
   completely dynamic. Reports and data sources can be moved across 
   users, organizations, and servers.

 * Expanded Big Data Connectivity - JasperReports Server now 
   supports:
   - Hive
   - Hortonworks HDP 1.3, 2.0 (Hive version 0.11x, 0.12x)
   - CDH 4.5.x- 5.1 (Hive version0.8x-0.13x)
   - Apache Cassandra 2.0
   - MongoDB 2.4.x
   - Cloudera Impala 1.3.1
   
   Note: if your version of Cassandra is 1.12.18 or higher, 
   JasperReports Server supports authentication when connecting 
   to it.

 * New Third-party platforms - JasperReports Server now 
   supports:
   - JBoss EAP 6.2
   - PostgreSQL 9.3
   - IBM DB2 10.5
   - MS SQL Server 2014
   - Windows 8.1
   - Ubuntu 14

 * TIBCO Spotfire Support - JasperReports Server now supports 
   the creation of reports that contain TIBCO Spotfire 6.5 
   Information Links using Jaspersoft Studio.   
   
For information regarding features added to 5.x releases, please
refer to the 5.6.1 release notes.

               * 4.7.1
 
To upgrade, start with the WAR File Distribution ZIP:
 
  jasperreports-server-6.0.1-bin.zip
 
It can be downloaded from the Jaspersoft Support site at
http://support.jaspersoft.com.
 
The recommended upgrade procedures are fully described in the
Upgrade Guide chapters 2, 3, and 4.
 
Note: If you are upgrading from JasperReports Server version
4.5 (or earlier) the upgrade involves substantial changes that 
may require you to plan and prepare beforehand. Please refer to 
Upgrade Guide Appendix A for advice regarding these important 
considerations. Also, see section 6.6 of these Release Notes. 

Database Changes
----------------

There are no jasperserver repository database changes between 6.0.0 
and 6.0.1. However, there were no database changes between 
version 5.5, 5.6.0, 5.6.1 and 6.0.0. 


6.2 Upgrade to 6.0.1 (Overlay Upgrade) (Tomcat Only)
------------------------------------------------------
 
The 5.1 release added an improved package for upgrading between 
versions called the Overlay Upgrade. 

This package supports a new procedure for upgrading from 
JasperReports Server 4.0 and above. It can preserve and give 
execution-time feedback on modified files and customizations 
found in your JasperReports Server instance. This allows the 
upgrade to preserve your customizations and gives you visibility 
into which files changed. 

This new procedure also supports rollback to put your original
web application instance back in place. 

This package is only implemented and certified to work with the 
Tomcat application server. All certified repository databases 
are supported.

Start by downloading the Overlay Upgrade package from 
http://support.jaspersoft.com. The package name is:

  jasperreports-server-overlay-upgrade-6.0.1.zip 

To start your overlay upgrade, unzip the package and open a 
command shell to the root of the package. Make sure to stop
your Tomcat instance. Then enter:

  overlay install    (this initiates the upgrade operation)

  You are prompted for a working folder (accept the default)
  
  It is assumed that you have a default_master.properties file
  from your original JasperReports Server installation. You are
  prompted for the path to this file. Enter the path.
  
  The overlay upgrade can now execute. 

Once the overlay upgrade is complete (and you have resolved any 
file conflicts), restart Tomcat. 

Additional Supported Commands:

    overlay help       (this displays all available commands)

For information on the overlay upgrade functionality, see the 
JasperReports Server Upgrade Guide Chapter 2.

 
6.3 Upgrade from 5.5 or 5.6.x to 6.0.1
--------------------------------------
 
To upgrade from 5.5 or 5.6.x, the recommended procedure is 
described in the Upgrade Guide Chapter 3. This procedure is run 
from the command line. Here is a summary of the steps used for 
this upgrade:  
 
  cd <unpacked-dir>/buildomatic
 
  cp sample_conf/<dbType>_master.properties  default_master.properties

  edit default_master.properties  (add your app server and db properties)

  ./js-upgrade-samedb.sh   (or js-upgrade-samedb.bat)
 
 
6.4 Upgrade from Older Versions
-------------------------------
 
This upgrade procedure lets you upgrade from any of the
JasperReports Server versions listed in this section's 
introduction (starting with version 3.7 through 5.6.x).
 
The recommended procedure is described in the Upgrade Guide 
Chapter 3. This procedure is run from the command line. Here is a
summary of the steps used for this upgrade procedure: 

  Export your existing JasperReports Server repository data
  (using the buildomatic/js-export.sh/bat command)
  (for example: ./js-export.sh --everything --output-zip my-export.zip)
  (Or export directly from the UI as of version 5.0 and later)

  cd <unpacked-dir>/buildomatic
 
  cp sample_conf/<dbType>_master.properties  default_master.properties

  edit default_master.properties  (add your app server and db 
  properties)

  ./js-upgrade-newdb.sh  <path>/my-export.zip 

  (or js-upgrade-newdb.bat <path>/my-export.zip)

 
6.5 Upgrade from Community Project
----------------------------------
 
If your current instance is the Community version, you can
follow the Upgrade Guide steps in Chapter 6 to upgrade
to the Commercial version.
 
 
6.6 Important Upgrade Information
---------------------------------

6.6.1 Changes in the 6.0.1 Release

Starting in this release, the server now incorporates a more 
recent version of the underlying Spring Security framework. 
We now use Spring Security 3. If you are upgrading from a 
previous version of JasperReports Server, you may need to 
take additional steps to accommodate the file structure of 
the new version of Spring. This is particularly the case if 
you have custom LDAP or SSO configured for the server. For 
more information, refer to the JasperReports Server 
External Authentication Guide.

6.6.2 Changes in the 5.6.0 Release

The 5.6.0 version included two changes that may require you to 
take additional steps during upgrade:

* JDBC Drivers: The 5.6.0 version did not include JDBC drivers 
  for some of the typical commercial databases (Oracle, 
  MS SQL Server, or DB2). In 5.6.1 and forward, we have included drivers for these  
  data sources; the manual steps required to add these drivers are no 
  longer necessary. For more information, see the documentation; 
  in particular:
  - Information on working with drivers during installation is in
    the JasperReports Server Installation Guide.
  - Information on working with drivers during upgrade is in
    the JasperReports Server Upgrade Guide.
  - Information on working with drivers in the web UI is in 
    the JasperReports Server Administrator Guide.

* Changes to OLAP engine: Due to a change between versions of the
  OLAP engine, if you use Jaspersoft OLAP's XML/A functionality 
  to connect to a remote JasperReports Servers XML/A sources, 
  you must take additional steps to complete your upgrade to 
  5.6.x. For information, see Known Issue 35985 (in these 
  release notes).

6.6.3 Additional Information on Planning for Upgrade

For additional information on planning for your upgrade please 
see Appendix A "Planning Your Upgrade" in the JasperReports 
Server Upgrade Guide. 


-----------------------------------------------------------------
7. Security Fixes 

* 36569: SECURITY - CVE-2014-0050. TIBCO Jaspersoft addressed a 
  vulnerability in the Apache Commons FileUpload component. 
  Previously, the server was potentially vulnerable to specially 
  crafted Content-type headers that can allow Denial of Service 
  attacks. In release 5.6.0, TIBCO Jaspersoft upgraded to Apache 
  Commons FileUpload component version 1.3.1 which addresses 
  this security issue. 
  
  For more information on the underlying issue, see:
  http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0050

-----------------------------------------------------------------
8. Known Issues

* 17824: While Fusion Charts support annotations, JasperReports
  Server and Jaspersoft Studio don't support them. Annotations 
  cannot be used in Pro Charts. We plan to address this issue in 
  a subsequent release.

* 21798: Performance in Internet Explorer. When JasperReports 
  Server is accessed through Microsoft Internet Explorer 8, 
  performance may be impaired. We recommends version 9 or 10 
  of Internet Explorer. Internet Explorer users should also note 
  that we no longer certify IE7. 
 
* 25258: When exporting your repository as part of the upgrade
  process from version 4.0.x, 4.1, or 4.2.x, an organization's
  theme is reset to the server's default theme. You must select
  View > Repository, navigate to the organization's Themes
  directory, and set the theme to active again. Due to the updated 
  default theme in 4.7, custom themes may need to be upgraded, 
  as described in the JasperReports Server Upgrade Guide.
   
* 30018: When an XML/A provider returns data to the Ad Hoc Editor,
  JasperReports Server sometimes must convert the datatype to 
  string. For example, an XML/A provider may return data of type 
  currency; in an Ad Hoc view, such currency data is a string 
  that displays as a symbol (such as $) and a number. When such 
  an XML/A-based Ad Hoc view is saved as a report, its datatypes 
  are converted again. JasperReports Server attempts to convert 
  the data to their original types, but in some cases, such as 
  currency, no such type is available, and so currency data is 
  converted to type double. In a report created from an Ad Hoc 
  view, XML/A data that was returned with datatype currency is 
  displayed as a number; the currency symbol is omitted. 
  We plan to address this issue in a subsequent release.

* 31955: In  Pro Charts (based on Fusion), Gantt charts do not 
  support HTML5 output format. We find that this limitation 
  originates in Fusion, and so have no plans to resolve it. 
  Fusion may address this issue in a subsequent release.
   
* 32159: When the 64-bit JasperReports Server binary installer 
  is run in some versions of Mac OSX (including Mac OSX 10.8.3), 
  and you select the option to install the bundled PostgreSQL, 
  an error appears if PostgreSQL 9.1 is already installed. The 
  message indicates that the process couldn't create a shared 
  memory segment, and directs you to further information in the 
  PostgreSQL documentation. For example, see 
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/static/kernel-resources.html, 
  which describes a workaround for the problem. We have 
  determined that this workaround can resolve the issue in the 
  JasperReports Server installer.

  Since the problem originates in the PostgreSQL installer, 
  we have no current plans for its resolution.
   
* 32168: Though we do not strictly support the practice, in 
  previous versions of JasperReports Server, it was possible 
  to create a clone install in JBoss by copying an existing 
  JasperReports Server WAR file and deploying it to a new JBoss 
  instance. With 5.1, Jaspersoft supports JBoss AS7/EAP6, but 
  has uncovered issues with clone installs. For more 
  information, refer to http://tinyurl.com/cv6ta2l.
  
* 33003: Export catalogs created through the web UI in 
  JasperReports Server version 5.1.x contain incorrect metadata. 
  When these catalogs are imported into JasperReports Server 
  version 5.2, the objects they contain are created in the wrong 
  location in the repository. To work around the problem, you 
  must edit the catalog manually to edit a single line in a text 
  file before importing it:
  1. Navigate the export catalog and locate the index.xml file. 
  2. Open the index.xml file in a text editor and locate this 
     text near the top of the file:
  
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
     <export><property name="pathProcessorId" value="zip"/>
     <property name="jsVersion" value="5.1.0 CE"/>
     <module id="repositoryResources"><folder>/public</folder>
     </module><module id="reportJobs"/></export>

  3. Update the jsVersion property to correctly identify the 
     version of JasperReports Server that created the catalog. 
     For example, change:
       <property name="jsVersion" value="5.1.0 CE"/>
     To:
       <property name="jsVersion" value="5.1.0 PRO"/>
  4. Save the file.
  5. Import the file into JasperReports Server.
  
* 35986 - If you use Jaspersoft OLAP's (R) XML/A functionality to 
   connect to a remote JasperReports Server's XML/A sources, you 
   must take additional steps to complete your upgrade.  You 
   must redefine your XML/A connections to specify the 
   connection string in a new way. For example, in previous 
   versions, the Foodmart XML/A connection specified: 
   
   Provider=Mondrian;DataSource=Foodmart
   
   In the new version, the DataSource portion of the 
   connection string is always JRS when the remote provider
   is JasperReports Server. For example:
   
   Provider=Mondrian;DataSource=JRS

* 40543: Jaspersoft uncovered a number of issues while 
  testing this release when deployed in Glassfish 3.1. They
  prevent us from supporting that specific version of Glassfish
  with this release. We found that the issue originates in the
  Spring framework, and so we have no plans to resolve it. 
  Pivotal may address this issue in a subsequent release.

  For more information, please see:
  https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-11389   
   
For information regarding known issues addressed in 5.x 
releases, please refer to the 5.6.1 release notes.

10. End of Support Notices

TIBCO Jaspersoft is in the process of ending support for several 
technologies:

* JasperReports Server no longer supports JDK 1.5.
  
* We have deprecated our Open Flash functionality in favor of 
  HTML5 solutions. In particular, the Flash samples that shipped 
  with previous versions of the server are no longer provided. 
  Also note that the Flash export option has been removed from the 
  report viewer. If you want to re-enable this option, you can 
  uncomment the exporter in a configuration file. 

  To do so, open the WEB-INF/flows/viewReportBeans.xml file and  
  uncomment this line:
  <entry key="swf" value-ref="swfExporterConfiguration"/>

* With the completion of the v2 REST API, we announced 
  the deprecation of the original REST API and the end-of-life 
  of the SOAP services. While these services will remain 
  available in the server for the time being, we 
  recommend that you migrate your integration to the latest 
  API available: Jaspersoft v2 REST API.
  
* For Mac OSX, we no longer support:
  * The 32 bit version of Apple OSX 
  * Apple OSX 10.5
  
* With the general availability of the commercial edition of 
  Jaspersoft Studio, we announced that iReport is now in 
  maintenance mode. We recommend that you migrate to Jaspersoft 
  Studio, which offers improvements beyond what is available in 
  iReport.

* With the addition of more advanced interactive behavior in the 
  report viewer, JasperReports Server no longer supports 
  interactivity in the xhtml report exporter. If you want 
  your reports to be interactive when viewed in the server, 
  you must use the default report exporter (html2). For more 
  information, see the JasperReports Server Administrator Guide.

* In April 2014, Microsoft ended support for its Windows XP
  operating system. For more information, see:
  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/xp/end-of-xp-support.aspx

* Support for some versions of our Jaspersoft BI Products, 
  including JasperReports, JasperReports Server, and iReport, 
  has ended:
  - Support for version 4.2.x ended on December 2, 2013.
  - Support for version 4.5.x ended on July 2, 2014.
  - Support for version 4.7.x ended on November 12, 2014.
 
* Version 6.0.0 is the last version that support Spring 
   Security 2.x. All releases after Version 6.0 will support 
   Spring 3.x and may require updates to any authentication 
   integration code that was written to work with prior 
   JasperReport Server releases.
